# Spooder &middot; ![tests status](https://github.com/Kruithne/spooder/actions/workflows/github-actions-test.yml/badge.svg) ![typescript](https://img.shields.io/badge/%3C%2F%3E-typescript-blue) [![license badge](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Kruithne/spooder?color=blue)](LICENSE)  ![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/spooder?color=blue)

`spooder` a purpose-built web server built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) that is specifically designed to run [my projects](https://github.com/Kruithne).

> **Warning** - This is not built for general-purpose use. I take no responsibility for any issues that may arise from using it.


### Why did you make this?

I maintain a large number of projects both personally and professionally that require web servers. For over a decade they have been running on [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)/[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)/[PHP](https://www.php.net/). While this has served me well, I decided it was time for change.

### Should I use it?

If it serves your needs and you're happy with it, then please feel free. If you are looking for a general-purpose web server that can be configured to your specific needs, I recommend [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

### Why does it lack X feature?

Functionality is added to `spooder` as required, and only if necessary. Since it is not intended for general use, plenty of configuration and checks are omitted in favour of performance and simplicity.
