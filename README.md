# Spooder - A Tiny Web Server
![tests status](https://github.com/Kruithne/spooder/actions/workflows/github-actions-test.yml/badge.svg) [![license badge](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Kruithne/spooder?color=blue)](LICENSE)

`spooder` is a tiny web server written in TypeScript with the goal of being simple to use and easy to extend.

- Zero dependencies by default.
- Extensible with middleware.
- Full [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) definitions.

## Why does this exist?

There's plenty of big fish in the pond when it comes to web servers; spooder is not designed to be one of them, in-fact it purposely does as little as possible, giving you complete control from the ground up.

With zero dependencies out of the box, spooder is designed to be as lightweight as possible, allowing you to extend it with it the way you want with middleware.

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install spooder
```
